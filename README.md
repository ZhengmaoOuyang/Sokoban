# Sokoban

# Bad Ice Cream 4 (May 2017 - June 2017)
My final project for ICS3U (Grade 11 Computer Science). Sokoban is a classic Japanese puzzle game where the player must push boxes onto marked tiles without being able to pull any boxes and without being able to push more than one box at a time. This game is a collection of Sokoban puzzles of varying difficulty.
